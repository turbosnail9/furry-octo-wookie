A hackathon is an event where teams build cool stuff together for 36 hours- sleep is optional, making awesome things is not. WearHacks is focused on wearable and connected technologies.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>Who can participate?</span></h3><p>Anyone from anywhere in the world can attend WearHacks. You don't have to be a programming or hardware whiz. We don’t even care about your major or area of study. If you want to learn about wearable technologies technologies, build something awesome and work with some of the brightest young minds out there, we want you at WearHacks.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>What if I'm new to all of this?</span></h3><p>No worries. It's definitely a plus to have prior coding or technical experience, but it's not a requirement. We'll have talks, mentors and workshops to help you with your project- Hackathons can be a great place to learn new skills in a short amount of time. Just come eager to learn, excited to meet lots of awesome people and most importantly, come ready to build.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>How much will WearHacks cost me?</span></h3><p>For the first 180 persons, WearHacks will absolutely free! Price of admission is a "can do" attitude and a burning desire to <i>get shit done</i>. After that first 180 tickets are gone, the price will be $15 a ticket, with a *wink* <i>special</i> discount for student hackers. Contact us to get the discount code. :)</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>What about food?</span></h3><p>We've got that covered. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and drinks will be served. Locally sourced. Completely free.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>I don’t have a team or an idea!</span></h3><p>Not a problem. Sign up on the <a href="http://wearhacks.sparkboard.com/">WearHacks SparkBoard</a>. You can join projects if you don't have an idea or create a project if you have an idea but no team. Either way, you're good to go!</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>How many people can be on my team?</span></h3><p>We do not have any specific requirements for team sizes, but keep in mind that the bigger your team the harder it will be to manage. We recommend a maximum team size of four people and encourage diversity.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>What should I bring?</span></h3><p>A laptop and cables/chargers are the essentials. If you have a hardware hack in mind that uses kits not being provided, then bring along the needed components! You can also bring your sleeping bag and toiletries.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>Can I start working on my project before WearHacks?</span></h3><p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that you can create projects and discuss your ideas on the <a href="http://wearhacks.sparkboard.com/">WearHacks SparkBoard</a>. We do not encourage participants to work on pre-existing projects as this goes against the spirit of hackathons. However, you can definitely familiarize yourself with the APIs, libraries and kits that you want to work on. We'll also be providing more info about the APIs that our sponsors will be providing, so stay tuned!</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>How does judging work?</span></h3><p>A group of judges will rate the hacks based on creativity, technical difficulty, design, and usefulness. Sponsors also evaluate projects that are competing for their respective prizes based on their own criteria. The top 10 overall projects will go to a final round of judging, where teams will demo what they built in front of all the judges and participants. We will be posting more details about our judges and judging categories closer to the event, along with what prizes are up for grabs.</p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>What kind of hardware will you guys have?</span></h3><p>So far we've got the following kits available for WearHacks:</p><p><a href="https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/">Thalmic Myo</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mbientlab.com/">MetaWear</a></p><p><a href="http://estimote.com/">Estimote</a></p><p><a href="http://hellonod.com/">Nod Ring</a></p><p><a href="http:http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus Rift</a></p><p><a href="https://intelligentheadset.com/">Intelligent Headset</a></p><p><a href="http://devicefactory.com/df1/">DF1</a></p><p><a href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">Muse Headband</a></p></div><div class="about-text" itemprop="description"><h3><span>I have a question that is not listed here.
